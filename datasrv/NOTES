-Need transaction queue for pull mode
-Need to handle reconnects (get list of all TRs from last time connected)
-Figure out how to handle check version timer and software upgrades
-Generic 'server id' independent of peer url
-Key meta data (e.g. creation host, lifespan, hosts its on, etc)
-Add an ssh tunnel manager
-Add a 'check' so that when the remote side of the tunnel isn't accessible, it restarts the tunnel
	- E.g. Host A opens tunnel TO Host B (ports 3032 local and remote)
	- Some time later, Host A can access Host B on 3032, BUT Host A is not getting any TX (last_seen is >X time) from Host B
	- Therefore, restart the tunnel
