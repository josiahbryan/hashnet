-Key meta data (e.g. creation host, lifespan, hosts its on, etc)
-Add an ssh tunnel manager
-Add a 'check' so that when the remote side of the tunnel isn't accessible, it restarts the tunnel
	- E.g. Host A opens tunnel TO Host B (ports 3032 local and remote)
	- Some time later, Host A can access Host B on 3032, BUT Host A is not getting any TX (last_seen is >X time) from Host B
	- Therefore, restart the tunnel
-Add integration to iptables top open up incoming port if needed
-Add a formal "one-way" peer mode (peer can poll, push, but the other peer cant reach this one)
