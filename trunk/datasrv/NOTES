-Key meta data (e.g. creation host, lifespan, hosts its on, etc)
-Add an ssh tunnel manager
-Add a 'check' so that when the remote side of the tunnel isn't accessible, it restarts the tunnel
	- E.g. Host A opens tunnel TO Host B (ports 3032 local and remote)
	- Some time later, Host A can access Host B on 3032, BUT Host A is not getting any TX (last_seen is >X time) from Host B
	- Therefore, restart the tunnel
-Add integration to iptables top open up incoming port if needed
-Change "old timestamp" check to an "edit sequence number"
	- need to package that seq num per key in transactions
	- theoretically, the seq num should sync across the network - TODO test this!
-Add a "long disconnect recovery" mode
	- Ex: laptop disconnected for > X transactions
	- Instead of downloading all TX in sequence, choose a peer (TODO what criteria) and download the DB as a 'tar' and start over txlog and peer tx #s
-Reexamine a tight "push" loop
-Add a formal "one-way" peer mode (peer can poll, push, but the other peer cant reach this one)
