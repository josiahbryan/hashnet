-Mouse offset when draging (so point doesnt 'snap' to mouse)
-Merge warp image code right into render() so we dont create multiple unecessary QImages
-Either re-enable offset vertex movement or create some sort of brush model
-Need to be able to undo or 'reset' the poly grid for an image
-General undo might be good
